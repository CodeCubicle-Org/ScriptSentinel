# ScriptSentinel

ScriptSentinel is a desktop utility that ensures the integrity of your script files. It leverages runtime hash comparison to detect any unauthorized changes. Upon detecting a mismatch, the application can be configured to automatically move the potentially compromised script to a designated quarantine directory, protecting your system from tampered code. Keep your operations secure and your mind at ease with ScriptSentinel.
