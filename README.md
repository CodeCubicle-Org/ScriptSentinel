# ScriptSentinel  //_a feature prototype for [@WorkHorz](https://github.com/CodeCubicle-Org/WorkHorz)_

ScriptSentinel is a desktop utility that ensures the integrity of your script files. It leverages runtime hash comparison to detect any unauthorized changes. Upon detecting a mismatch, the application can be configured to automatically move the potentially compromised script to a designated quarantine directory, protecting your system from tampered code. Keep your operations secure and your mind at ease with ScriptSentinel.

## C++ Code Here
The example code here is modern C++23 open source code under GPL3, the Windows binary shows some more features that can be achieved with this concept. The binaries can be used for free but not be sold or used in any commercial context without written permission or license.

## Final Product
This concept of protecting scripts before execution, meaning before they could cause harm if tampered, will be included into ther WorkHorz project eventually. This will include additional features to harden your scripts and the ScriptSentinel on the server or the desktop.

## Get Security For Your Own Code
